		<h3><em>Read what people are saying about Revolution Computer Services...</em></h3>
		<blockquote>I have greatly appreciated Lucas’ assistance with our family’s computer problems. He has never hesitated offering to find and fix the problem, or offer other viable solutions. I was so pleased when he set up my new laptop, providing enhancements and programs that would enable me to easily operate the system and do what I needed to do with my limited technical knowledge. When my son thought his netbook was unusable because of some damage, Lucas was able to diagnose the problem and repair the damage for us. Lucas was also happy to host him at work for a job-shadow opportunity where he learned so much and spurred his interest in computers and computer technology! We are extremely happy with the computer care and technical knowledge Lucas has provided us with over the years.
		<small>Susanne Marchment, Kitchener</small></blockquote>
		<blockquote>I initially approached Lucas with several computer issues. He was able to walk me through each situation, and after some evaluation he explained to me what each problem was in detail. He told me which parts I would need to replace, and about how much all of it would cost. A few weeks after Lucas finished repairing those computers, I presented him with a new dilemma related to wireless communication between routers located in different homes. Before I met Lucas, I had asked Best Buy's Geek Squad to solve the issue. They tried a few different ideas, but they were expensive, and none were successful. I brought the problem to Lucas, and although he admitted he had little experience with the situation, together we were able to come up with an affordable solution that worked perfectly!
